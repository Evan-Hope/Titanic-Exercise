# Titanic-Exercise
In this exercise, I will use passenger data from the Titanic in order to predict the likelihood of a passenger surviving the tragedy given various variables about the
passenger. (Sex, age, ticket fare, etc). I will do so by implementing 4 different predictive models and see which model returns the most accurate results. **Minor spoiler** 
 I will also use ROC and AUC curves to help visualize how well the "winning" model fits the data.
